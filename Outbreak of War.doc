war: By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to
          invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and
          British military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to
          invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the
          Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret
          negotiations led on August 23â€“24 to the signing of the German-Soviet
          Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and
          the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the western
          third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken
          over by the U.S.S.R.
